# podman-demo

This repo is nothing more than a `Dockerfile` that podman can use to build
an image. The point of this demo is to illustrate that podman can create
Docker-compatible images that conform to the Open Container Initiative (OCI)
image format.

The `Dockerfile` is built with Fedora / `dnf` in mind. If you're using CentOS
or RHEL or some other Linux distro, you'll may have to modify the `Dockerfile`
for your platform.
